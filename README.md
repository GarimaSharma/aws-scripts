aws-scripts
===========

Some handy scripts, mostly written in python-boto, to make your life easier. 
* All the scripts are released under GPLv3 unless and otherwise mentioned specifically in the script itself.
* Almost all the scripts assume that the aws key and secret can be read from ~/.aws.conf
